Challenge Statement :
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Imp Note:
In this python notebook I have only used Age as a factor for prediction, other features can be used as independent variables as well for prediction. Also, I have removed all the rows with null values these values can be imputed and the model can be trained. To get better results, use all the other features(independent variables) to get accurate results for Survived prediction(dependent variable)
